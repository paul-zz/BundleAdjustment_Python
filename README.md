# BundleAdjustment_Python
This is a bundle adjustment program using BAL dataset implemented on Python.
## Notice
I'm sorry that you clicked in this repository because

This is **NOT a SLAM research** but only part of my homework of Numeric Methods course, so this is **NOT** gonna be a fast implementation. :)

But if you would like to help me improve my coding, I'd be really happy.

The main goal of this project is to use different non-linear optimization algorithms, and compare their efficiency by solving BA.

If you want a efficient implementation for SLAM, please use G2O or Ceres instead.
